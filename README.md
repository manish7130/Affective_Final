#### TO run

Required installation - python, browser (anything but Safari)

```
git clone <THIS REPO>
cd Affective_Final
python -m http.server
```
Note: assumes `python` command is python3. Your installation may require using `python3` instead.

Once you see 'serving HTTP on ..... port 8000'

Either:
Go to the browser (Chrome preferred because we're working on Google Forms) 
Type in localhost:8000

Or:
Open the URL displayed in Terminal on Browser for demo.
